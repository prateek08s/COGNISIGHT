# Fusing AI Vision and Expressive Audio for Enhanced Environmental Perception

## Abstract

The visually impaired and elderly face challenges in recognizing objects, hindering their daily lives. This project aims to enhance their vision by utilizing machine learning techniques to provide accurate object recognition and generate detailed descriptions. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) will be employed to analyze images and create captions. The system's architecture, leveraging deep learning neural networks, will sequentially produce text captions, transformed into audible speech output using the Google Text-to-Speech API. Training on sizable datasets will establish associations between visual concepts and descriptive language. Optimized deep learning models, such as CNN-RNN, will ensure effective inference on devices with limited resources. The desired outcome is a program that recognizes environments through images, providing the blind and visually impaired with valuable audio descriptions to comprehend visual objects and scenes, significantly improving independence and quality of life.

## Introduction

In a world where over 2.2 billion visually impaired and elderly individuals face daily challenges in recognizing objects, this project introduces an innovative assistive vision system. The system, powered by machine learning and neural networks, aims to provide the visually impaired with detailed image captions and spoken descriptions, enhancing their understanding of their surroundings and fostering independence.

## Motivation & Significance

The primary goal is to improve the quality of life for visually impaired individuals by creating visual aids that enhance daily performance and autonomy. Key objectives include developing an application to help the visually impaired understand their environment, generating captions converted to speech, developing a neural network model for caption generation, and addressing gaps in visual context. The project's transformative potential lies in its innovative use of technology to bridge the gap between the visual world and the lives of visually impaired individuals.

## Objectives

1. Develop an application to assist visually impaired individuals in understanding their environment.
2. Generate captions for images, converting them to speech for improved clarity.
3. Develop a neural network model for caption generation and an API to link captions to speech.
4. Address gaps in visual context through comprehensive project methods.
